<h1>i like to go swimming in the summer</h1>
</br>
<p>Swimming is my most favourite activity in the summer.When the sun is shining</br> and the air is warm,you will find me dipping into my backyard pool.it's not</br> an impressive pool,only three feet deep,but it's mine.</p></br>
There are three reasons I like to swim:
<ul>
<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
<li>I have an oppurtunity to be in the Sun</li>
</li>
